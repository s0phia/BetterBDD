Feature: This is a duplicate feature name

  AS an agile team member
  I WANT the ability to run a rule that checks for duplicate feature names
  SO THAT I can avoid duplicated feature names in my BDD test suite

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given Mary has a Facebook account
    And she is on the login page
    When she enters her login details
    Then her personal homepage is displayed
