# Rule: duplicate_feature_name

Feature: This is a duplicate feature name

  AS an agile team member
  I WANT the ability to run a rule that checks for duplicate feature names
  SO THAT I can avoid duplicated feature names in my BDD test suite


  Scenario: Successful registration
    Given Mary does not have a Facebook account
    And she is on the registration page
    When she submits valid registration details
    Then the successful registration message is displayed
